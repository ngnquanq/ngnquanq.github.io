title: "On Enhancing Deep Embedded Clustering for Intent
Mining in Goal-Oriented Dialogue Understanding"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-03-15-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Discovering user intents plays an indispensable role in natural lan-
guage understanding and automated dialogue response. However, labeling intents
for new domains from scratch is a daunting process that often requires extensive
manual effort from domain experts. To this end, this paper proposes an unsu-
pervised approach for discovering intents and automatically producing intention
labels from a collection of unlabeled utterances in the context of the banking
domain. A proposed two-stage training procedure includes deploying Deep Em-
bedded Clustering (DEC), wherein we made significant modifications by using
the Sophia optimizer and the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to simultane-
ously learn feature representations and cluster assignments. A set of intent labels
for each cluster is then generated by using a dependency parser in the second
stage. We empirically show that the proposed unsupervised approach is capable
of generating meaningful intent labels and short text clustering while achieving
high evaluation scores.'
