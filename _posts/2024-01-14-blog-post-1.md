Hey there! Ever wondered how computers understand sentences? ðŸ¤– Well, in this paper, we break down the magic of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sentence classification. No rocket science, just a friendly chat about how these clever algorithms make sense of language. Dive in to explore the secrets of CNNs and make sense of the NLP world! ðŸ§ âœ¨
